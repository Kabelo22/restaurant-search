## Areas of improvements

- I would have loved to use reactjs for this application, but I chose to use nodejs and html with ejs as it is what I'm familiar with right now. The next phase of my learning covers chapters on reactjs.

- I think I could have done error handling better. For now I just console log the error in the catch section.
